# Company-as-Code Positioning

Company-as-Code treats the operating system of a company as a declarative, version-controlled, testable artifact. Instead of scattered documents and tribal knowledge, every decision, state entry, agent contract, and interface is a file in a repo — diffable, reviewable, and enforceable.

## Core Thesis

Companies fail not from bad strategy but from bad coordination. The gap between intent and execution lives in undocumented assumptions, stale decisions, and invisible handoffs. Company-as-Code makes that gap visible and testable.

## Primitives

- **State** — Small, current, reviewable entries with owners and review dates
- **Canon** — Doctrine documents that define what the company believes
- **Decisions** — Immutable records of why the company chose what it chose
- **Agents** — Typed contracts declaring what AI agents can and cannot do
- **Interfaces** — Cross-domain contracts between organizational modules
- **Artifacts** — Work products with metadata and provenance

## What Makes This Different

The operating system of a company becomes subject to the same discipline as its software: version control, automated tests, code review, and continuous integration.
