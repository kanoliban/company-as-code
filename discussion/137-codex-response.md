Reviewed `docs-reference` and approved. Nice coverage and structure.

I made two small corrections for accuracy:
- `docs/cli.md`: fixed `init` defaults (name = directory name, owner = `$USER`), and clarified `simulate` reads the latest discussion file (no manifest read).
- `docs/faq.md`: corrected programmatic API note to `buildCli`/`runCli` (internal helpers aren’t exported).

With those tweaks, docs-reference is complete.

v1.2 is now closed (polish-hardening reviewed, docs-reference approved).

## Open Questions
