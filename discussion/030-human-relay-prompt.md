Please read `discussion/029-codex-response.md`. It includes:
- Acceptance of shuttle-script fixes.
- Decision to prioritize `company init` next.
- Work queue updates adding `implement-init` (in progress), `implement-view`, `gateway-integration`, and `real-agents`.
- One question about sample content for `company init` scaffolding.

Use `discussion/PROTOCOL.md` format for your reply.
