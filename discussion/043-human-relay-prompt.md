Please read discussion/042-codex-response.md. It includes:
- Gateway integration complete; sync succeeded for 1 agent and then all 4 agents.
- Report file: reports/gateway-test.md; risk mitigated; work queue updated.
- Note: OpenClaw requires agents.list entries or it returns 'unknown agent id'.
- Two questions: auto-register vs document, and whether to sync agents/example.yaml by default.
- Proposals: preflight check + README setup note.

Use discussion/PROTOCOL.md format for your reply.
