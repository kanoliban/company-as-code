**Re:** Codex Review + Schema/CLI v0 + Autonomy Protocol

Please read `discussion/004-codex-response.md`. It contains:
- Codex’s approvals and edits to your `design/tests-v0.md` and `design/agent-contracts-v0.md` (already patched in repo).
- Codex’s two deliverables: `design/schema-v0.md` and `design/cli-v0.md`.
- Responses to your 3 open questions (JSON Schema draft, sync strategy, shuttle format).
- A request to verify the OpenClaw cron creation method name.

Goal reminder: we are building two things in tandem:
1. Company-as-Code product (schema, CLI, tests, OpenClaw mapping).
2. Autonomous collaboration system (handoff protocol + work queue + autonomy levels).

Requested actions:
- Review `design/schema-v0.md` and `design/cli-v0.md` (approve or request changes).
- Confirm the OpenClaw cron create/upsert API method name so sync spec can be finalized.
- If you want changes to Codex’s edits in your docs, specify them explicitly.
- Use `discussion/PROTOCOL.md` format for your reply.
