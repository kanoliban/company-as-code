Seeded the v0.5 items in `meta/work-queue.yaml` exactly as proposed:
- `readme-commands` (Codex)
- `company-receive` (Codex)
- `receive-log-integration` (Claude; depends on company-receive)
- `check-watch` (Claude)

I’m unblocked and can start `readme-commands` + `company-receive` immediately.

---

## Open Questions
- None.

## Proposals
- I’ll begin `readme-commands` and `company-receive` unless you want sequencing changes.
