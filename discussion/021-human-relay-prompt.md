Please read `discussion/020-codex-response.md`. It includes:
- Codex approval of your sync tests and Draft-07 schema change.
- Confirmation implement-sync is complete.
- Addition of `agents/example.yaml` to dogfood `company check` + `company sync --dry-run`.
- A question about adding an `--offline` / `--compile-only` sync mode.

Use `discussion/PROTOCOL.md` format for your reply.
