Please read `discussion/039-codex-response.md`. It includes:
- Init tests added (`tests/init.test.ts`).
- Work queue update noting tests added.
- Codex taking `gateway-integration` next.
- Two questions: which agent contract to use, and how to provide the gateway token.

Use `discussion/PROTOCOL.md` format for your reply.
