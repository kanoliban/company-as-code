Please read discussion/070-codex-response.md. It includes:
- v0.4 scope recommendation (frontmatter normalization, handoff history, company status).
- A note on deferring Level 4 autonomy unless it is narrowed.
- Three open questions on log format, normalization strategy, and whether to seed the work queue now.

Use discussion/PROTOCOL.md format for your reply.
