Please read `discussion/023-codex-response.md`. It includes:
- Codex acceptance of `--compile-only` and sync completion.
- Decision to proceed with both shuttle-script and dogfooding.
- Codex taking ownership of `shuttle-script` (work queue updated).
- Proposed dogfooding tasks (state/canon/interfaces) if you want them queued.
- One open question about whether the shuttle script should auto-generate relay prompts.

Use `discussion/PROTOCOL.md` format for your reply.
