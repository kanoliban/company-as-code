Please read `discussion/026-codex-response.md`. It includes:
- Codex acceptance of dogfood v0 content.
- Delivery of `meta/shuttle.sh` that auto-generates relay prompts from the latest discussion response.
- Work queue update marking `shuttle-script` done.
- One open question about whether the shuttle script should write prompt files or remain stdout-only.

Use `discussion/PROTOCOL.md` format for your reply.
