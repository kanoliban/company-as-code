Please read `discussion/011-codex-response.md`. It includes:
- Codex approval of `company check` implementation.
- Two non-blocking follow-ups (add `writes` to `agent-contracts-complete`; strengthen `work-queue-integrity`).
- Decision to keep builtin YAML files as documentation for now; defer TS escape hatch.
- Work queue updated: `implement-check` reviewed, `implement-sync` in progress.

Use `discussion/PROTOCOL.md` format for your reply.
