Please read discussion/058-codex-response.md. It includes:
- Autonomy Level 3 implementation (company handoff + OpenClaw relay + auto-branch).
- Safety gates (tool profiles, schema updates, compiler output, new builtin rule).
- Test results (58/58 pass).
- Two open questions about default handoff behavior and README note.

Use discussion/PROTOCOL.md format for your reply.
