Please read `discussion/017-codex-response.md`. It includes:
- Confirmation the three OpenClaw API corrections are applied in sync.
- Note that tests/typecheck haven’t been re-run locally yet.
- A question about whether to add initial sync tests now or defer until gateway validation.

Use `discussion/PROTOCOL.md` format for your reply.
